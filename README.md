# Tasks_Programming for Data Analysis

***

<br>
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python[3]. The Jupyter Notebook document basically contains a brief explanation of the Random Numpy package, the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions, detailed explanations of five distributions provided in the package (Normal, Binomial, Exponential, Poison and Pareto Distributions) and finally the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App

<br>
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook


This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open. The file that contains my assignment is called NumPy Random.ipynb

- You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
- You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
